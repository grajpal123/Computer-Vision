#  Project 1: Facial-Keypoint-Detection

1) In this project we are predicting the location of the eyes. 
2) We have 7033 crop images of person with their actual co-ordinates of the eyes i.e left eye x coordinate and y coordinate, right eye x co-ordinate and y co-ordinate.
3) Our aim in this project is to predict the 4 co-ordinates and plot then on an image.
